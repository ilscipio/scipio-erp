# SCIPIO: When the controller redirects HTTP to HTTPS, determines the format of the redirect link produced. Values:
# * incoming-url: Uses part of the incoming original request URL, but changing the protocol, host and port.
#                 The port is taken from static configuration (url.properties or WebSite), others from HTTP headers.
# * incoming-url-statichost: Same as incoming-url, but the host is taken from static configuration (url.properties
#                            or WebSite) instead of HTTP headers.
# * ofbiz-url: Generates a new URL from scratch based on the target controller request URI (i.e., based on @ofbizUrl)
# NOTE: None of these options guarantee preserving the public-facing URL format when behind a load balancer such as nginx;
#     there is typically a need for local URL rewriting (urlrewritefilter.xml) and static configuration files (url.properties,
#     WebSite records, etc.) together with HTTP headers from the frontend (X-Forwarded-Proto, etc.).
