            Screen Widget Definitions
        
            SCIPIO: In Scipio, the screen widget language is modified from stock Ofbiz with new elements and
            modifications to existing elements. The renderer is modified accordingly, and it may have yet
            additional changes not visible through the language elements alone (may be noted here).
            Some webapp-specific renderer configuration is done through web.xml 
            (see descriptions in component://resources/templates/web.xml and component://webtools/webapp/webtools/WEB-INF/web.xml).
            Patterns, their descriptions and usage examples can be found in CommonScreens.xml of Common and Admin apps
            (see component://common/widget/CommonScreens.xml and component://webtools/widget/CommonScreens.xml).
            Changes are prefixed with the string "SCIPIO:" in annotations and comments.
            
            Features and Modifications (including but not limited to):
            * Decorator sections have extended controls to allow auto-inclusion, delegation and
              conditional definitions. (auto-decorator-section-include, override-by-auto-include, use-when)
            * decorator-screen element supports a fallback screen/location when named screen is not found
            * In Scipio standard implementation, label and section title styles support an advanced
              syntax. (label's style, title-style)
            * New screen-settings element and construct for new screen configurable options and defaults, 
              which are applied to all screens in a file or screen-group.
              * auto-include-settings allows automatically applying settings from CommonScreens.xml (specially-recognized)
                to the other screen files (*Screens.xml) found statically in the same local folder and subfolders.
              * decorator-screen-settings allows configuring the default behavior of the decorator-screen
                element; supports settings a default fallback location for all screens in a file (usually
                in conjunction with mainDecoratorLocation) (and/or all adjacent files, with auto-include-settings)
                Allows implementing a common central decorator pattern using mainDecoratorLocation (pointing to CommonScreens.xml),
                where mainDecoratorLocation is used liberally as the only parametrized decorator location without consequence 
                to application extensibility (the only constraint being that decorator names should be as globally unique as possible).
              * render-init settings allows defining statically auto-included actions for all screens of a file
                (and/or all adjacent files, with auto-include-settings), which are executed for the first of the local 
                screens encountered in a request or in other words the screen used as the target view.
                Eliminates the need to include guarded shared actions manually into every screen in the application,
                and for context variables can eliminate need for the global context (frequently problematic).
            * The renderer allows auto-including webapp-specific actions at render init (in addition to 
              statically included ones mentioned above), which are swapped per-webapp, via web.xml context-param
              renderInitScriptScreenLocation, similar to main-decorator. 
              In fact, configuring renderInitScriptScreenLocation is not necessary, as it has
              a default which is to lookup the screen named "webapp-common-actions" in the location specified
              by mainDecoratorLocation (already in most apps' web.xml file).
              Allows setting webapp-swappable context fields, with eliminated need for global context and 
              dangerous parameters map usage.
            * The renderer supports custom initial context populating modification scripts, either 
              system wide (widgetContextScripts.properties) or per-webapp (widgetContextScriptLocation - web.xml).
              
            To use this and other widget XML schema definition files (*.xsd) in your development environment for autocompletion and validation,
            import the file named ".xmlcatalog.xml" from the Scipio project root as XML Catalog file/project type using import dialog.
            Note this also includes the definition files for all other Scipio/ofbiz XML resources such as entity models, service defs, etc.

                    Screen element.
                    
                    SCIPIO: 2016-11-11: This element is enhanced so promote clearer definitions of actions-only
                    screens. To this end it now allows an actions element as direct child of screen element, instead of
                    forcing a section element declaration. The section element itself also no longer forces the widgets element.
                    
                    An actions-only screen is one that contains an actions element, but no section condition nor fail-widgets elements, 
                    and it cannot have more than one widgets element which must be empty if present (this is merely to support old-style actions-only screens).
                    (Special case: if has empty widgets element and empty actions, it will be considered a widgets screen placeholder, not actions-only)
                    New code should omit the widgets element. Note that the section condition is considered part of widgets, because
                    it is implemented outside the actions and complicates their reuse - in its place the actions now supports their own master if condition
                    (see widget-common.xsd if element, added for 1.14.3). It should generally be considered an error to use section condition with 
                    actions-only screen.
                    
                    It is highly ENCOURAGED to OMIT the section element if you are defining an actions-only screen definition, 
                    so the intent is clear and discourages the erroneous addition of widgets elements to it;
                    in turn this allows the include-screen-actions directive to work properly (include-screen-actions only includes the actions 
                    from the top section actions in a screen, and it bypasses the condition element, only supporting the master if directive instead).
                    2016-11-11: Enhanced for 1.14.3.

                    Used in conjunction with targeted rendering, to avoid executing parts not needed, for optimization.
                    This is a shortcut to writing manual verbose conditions manual everywhere.
                    Usually used as blacklist.
                    
                    This uses close syntax to the targeted rendering "scpRenderTargetExpr" parameter,
                    which may be passed to ajax render and other render modes.
                    This documentation also describes some of the features of the query parameter.
                    
                    Format:
                    Consists of a comma-separated list of names that may include wildcards "*" (max one per name).
                    Names may refer to element names, id values, or other.
                    Spaces are ignored, and has no flexible expression support.
                    Each name can be directly prefixed with a Matching Element Type character, which denotes
                    what widget element or attribute value the name will match against.
                    An exclusion/negation "!" character may be prefixed before the type character to cause exclusion (blacklist)
                    of the name instead of inclusion (whitelist), to denote that the element does not contain another.
                    The last entry in the full expression (after a comma) should always be
                    either match-all "*" or match-none "!*", to prevent ambiguity and to explicitly show to both
                    users and renderer whether the intent was to write a blacklist or whitelist, respectively.
                    
                    Matching Element Types:
                    * "$" - specific, matches "section" element "name" attribute value - considered GLOBAL in scope (across includes)
                            also matches FTL "@virtualSection" directive invocation "name" argument.
                    * "#" - specific, matches "container", "screenlet" elements "id" attribute value - considered GLOBAL in scope (across includes)
                            also matches some FTL directive invocations that support IDs (see below)
                    * "~" - specific, matches "decorator-section-include" element "name" attribute value - considered LOCAL in scope (to current decorator layer)
                            NOTE: this uses an optimization to automatically blacklist the decorator-section-include invocations on the current
                                level that don't match the specified name.
                            NOTE: this selector is mostly useful for scpRenderTargetExpr parameter rather than contains-expression.
                    * "^" - specific, special 'skipping' decorator-section matcher
                            TODO: NOT IMPLEMENTED
                    * "%" - generic, widget element selector, matches the element tag name (most elements supported, not guaranteed all).
                            optionally can add brackets "%tagname[name=SomeName]" or "%tagname[id='some-id']" to only match elements with given name or id.
                            NOTE: only name and id attributes are supported, and support is best-effort.
                            NOTE: this selector is mostly useful for scpRenderTargetExpr parameter rather than contains-expression.
                            FIXME: the attributes in brackets will not work properly inside contains-expressions
                            FIXME: this selector may currently bypass optimizations, so it should only be used in queries as the last entry.
                    * "@" - generic, LIMITED FTL directive invocation selector, matches "@section" and "@container" invocations
                            supports "@macroname[id=some-id]" attribute (only ID).
                            NOTE: it is usually better to use the #id selector instead of this; it will also match
                                those few FTL directives.
                            FIXME: the attributes in brackets will not work properly inside contains-expressions
                            
                    NOTE: These are the same types supported by the scpRenderTargetExpr targeted rendering parameter.

                    Other Special Characters:
                    * "*" - wilcard
                            WARN: limited support in scpRenderTargetExpr parameter; may prevent optimizations with contains-expression interaction.
                    * "!" - exclude/negation
                            NOTE: not supported in scpRenderTargetExpr parameter

                    Specificity: 
                    Names without wildcards always match first, followed by partial wildcard, and finally full wildcard.
                    On a given level, include has priority over exclude, but wildcard-less exclude has priority over wildcard include.
                    
                    Default: "*" (matches all)
                    
                    ex.: 
                      "!$MySection1, !$MySection2, !$MySection-*, *" (blacklist)
                      "$MySection1, $MySection-*, #my-container-1, !*" (whitelist)
                      
                    NOTE: These expressions are required for optimization, to be able to skip code execution not related
                        to the target element.
                        If the decorator does not blacklist anything, targeted rendering will still work, because
                        the non-targeted output will still be prevented; but the renderer will still execute the data 
                        preparation for all those null-output elements, which may (or may not) be expensive.

                    <!-- DEV NOTES:
                      * Security: The decorators are responsible for implementing the majority of render-related security 
                        checks. The controller heavily depends on the screens to perform their own security checks.
                        Everything written above here, below, and in the java files must take into account the security checks.
                      * TODO?: Automatic contains-expression generation: 
                        There is a very limited possibility for automatic generation of contains-expressions by the renderer 
                        in the future; e.g. it can try to work out some relations based on the screen's immediate definitions.
                        However this becomes extremely complex and may require assumptions that will break decorators and screens.
                        As general rule, it is physically impossible for the render to build these, because most of the
                        elements targeted will cross decorator boundaries i.e. decorator-section-include elements.
                        Only a limited set of other types of includes can be followed, because many are parametrized using
                        flexible expressions and only resolved at runtime (e.g. location="${parameters.mainDecoratorLocation}").
                        So only local definitions and hardcoded includes can be used, and it requires making the assumption
                        that the definitions are exclusive to the screen, e.g. are not found in the decorator-section-includes,
                        which would break composed decorators such as the shop decorator. 
                        More generally there is a computational impossibility associated with trying to predict what code
                        is going to do without actually running it. 
                      * TODO?: Alternate targeted rendering widget extraction method:
                        In targeted rendering, it is currently in most cases essential to execute all code in the decorators
                        (except where explicitly blacklisted as non-relevant using contains-expression).
                        i.e. it is currently dangerous and usually invalid to try to extract parts of a screen for standalone execution.
                        This is primarily because the decorators implement most of the security checks, and also because
                        many widgets rely on the global actions performed by the decorators.
                        The only way this would be possible would be to in turn extract the security checks and global actions
                        from the decorators to run them along with the extracted screen parts, but currently this is impossible,
                        because there is no way or global pattern to identify the decorator code needed to extract (especially
                        the security checks). Realistically this may never happen. -->

                Renders the named screen and includes the children of this elements at the point where it finds the decorator-section-include tag.
                Note that because of the recursive nature of this tag the share-scope attribute is not available.
                SCIPIO: NOTE: This directive is highly enhanced from stock ofbiz, and further for Scipio 1.14.2.
                It now supports passing through and conditionally defining decorator-sections.
                For 1.14.2, the default for Scipio's new auto-decorator-section-include attribute has been
                changed to true, and the language now allows omitting children elements. As a result,
                it can fully substitute for and is preferable (for decorators) to include-screen directive using the simple form:
                    &lt;decorator-screen name="SomeDecorator" location="component//..." /&gt;
                In addition, this directive now supports a fallback-location reference used when the main
                location#name resolve to a missing decorator; this can be used together with the new
                screen-settings element to setup application-wide fallback behavior with few code changes.

                        In other words, the caller's decorator-section, if present, will override this decorator-section.

                We don't really want to encourage the use of the html-template-decorator, should be done on the screen level.
                To include the sections in the decorator template just use the "render(sectionName)" method "sections" object, FTL example: ${sections.render("main")}.
                For more
                efficient use the sections.render(sectionName, writer) method should be used, in FTL this would be in a transform or something.

                    element is ignored if found in any other file.
                    The children include directives are essentially copied into the other screen files,
                    into the root screens element, before the file's own settings (if any).
                    When a screen file is rendered, it will first look for this section in the CommonScreens.xml
                    file residing in the same folder; if not found, it will look in the parent directory,
                    recursively, until the top component://componentname/widget/ folder is reached.
                    This powerful directive helps avoid error-prone redundancy in screen files.
                    NOTE: Does not work with screen-groups; only inserts into root screens/group.
