        This uses solrconfig.properties to enable/disable, but can be removed manually if needed. -->
    <!-- NOTE: 2017-08-30: Together with recent job engine patch, this is now configured so that an error at startup will trigger
        retries during the execution, IN ADDITION TO the recurrence that is created for the next startup (previously, no retries were done).
        To disable the retry attempts, simply set maxRetry="0" here. -->
