        NOTE: The Admin app screen and related definitions have the double-purpose of implementing Admin

        to this end it also frequently contains descriptions of many patterns used throughout the backend.
        Some descriptions are also found instead in the common component files such as component://common/widget/CommonScreens.xml and CommonMenus.xml,
        and others in the create-component templated files under framework/resources/templates/Screens.xml and Menus.xml.

            it will look in our CommonScreens.xml file here instead.
            This prevents the worst application extensibility issues related to the heavy use of mainDecoratorLocation, so that extending applications
            can safely include screens from our app without having to worry about missing decorators in its own CommonScreens.xml file (which otherwise crashes).
            It also mitigates the versatility loss that comes from using a generic parameters.mainDecoratorLocation rather than hundreds of specific 
            parameters.commonXxxDecoratorLocation fields (this is the compromise: mainDecoratorLocation with default-fallback-location is slightly less versatile, 
            but it makes overriding decorators easier, with no need to edit web.xml).
            NOTE: For mainDecoratorLocation overriding to work correctly (with or without this fallback) w.r.t. application extensibility, the decorators referenced through 
                parameters.mainDecoratorLocation should have globally unique names across all CommonScreens.xml files, so apps should take
                care to avoid too generic names in their CommonScreens.xml files, or if they share names,
                it means the decorators would be interchangeable.

    <!-- SCIPIO: App-wide common decorator, wrapper around main-decorator; expected to have globally unique name.
        Every webapp is EXPECTED to provide a version of this decorator named uniquely after themselves (following "CommonXxxAppDecorator" by convention).
        
        This wrapper simplifies the other decorators and screens by providing a common static reusable point for
        code such as permission check, and if need arises it also allows extending apps that extend multiple applications to 
        specifically override screen code for this specific application only (important for permissions to
        be re-implemented correctly by the extending app).
        
        This decorator (pattern) was originally primarily designed to provide a central point for statically-reusable code; in other
        words, permission checks and code that would otherwise be copy-pasted in each top screen or their intermediate decorators,
        and that are logically tied to the screens (for example, queries of entities specific to webtools are tied to WEBTOOLS_VIEW perm check).
        Nevertheless, because this is usually included using "${parameters.mainDecoratorLocation}", it is
        possible for a webapp extending this one to override this decorator. The main reason for doing so would be to add
        code that modifies the behavior of only the screens of one specific application it is extending (this is
        otherwise not easily possible with the patterns in stock ofbiz).
        However, if overriding this way, the extending webapp must take care to fulfill the static contract of the original
        decorator, especially permission checks; the screens rely on this. The easiest way is to simply delegate
        statically to the original decorator, if the changes allow. Note that this also true for many of the other
        intermediate decorators typically named CommonXxxDecorator. -->
